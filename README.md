TwilightSLAM is a graduate course final project at the University of Michigan for the course *ROB 530: Mobil Robotics* with the objective of investigating state-of-the-art technologies for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) tasks in low-light or twilight-like environments.

As this project was worked on by 5 students, system requirements vary for each repository. Each image enhancment module and SLAM framework provides a detailed README.
